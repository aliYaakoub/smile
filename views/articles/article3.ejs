        <div class="paragraphes">
            <p>The Lebanese liquidity crisis is an ongoing financial crisis affecting the nation of Lebanon, 
            starting in August 2019, which further exacerbated by both the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon (which began in 2020)
            and the 2020 Beirut port explosion. </p>
            <p>Since 1997, the Lebanese pound has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 1,507.5 LBP per USD. 
            In August 2019, due to various financial hardships, especially the growing probability that the Lebanese 
            government will default on maturing debt obligations, the black market exchange rate started diverging 
            from the official exchange rate. </p>
            <p>In the fourth quarter of 2019, the black market exchange rate reached 1,600 LBP per USD, and increased 
            to 3,000 LBP per USD in April 2020, 14,000 LBP per USD in March 2021, 15200 LBP per USD in June 2021 
            and 23,000 LBP per USD in July 2021.The USD black market exchange rate continues to fluctuate substantially 
            due to devaluation of the Lebanese pound caused by acute USD shortages within Lebanon. This dollar shortage 
            also caused 785 restaurants and cafes to close between September 2019 and February 2020 and resulted in 
            25,000 employees losing their jobs. Consumer goods prices have increased by 580% since October resulting 
            from the worst economic crisis in decades. This economic crisis made Lebanon's gross domestic product fall 
            to about 44 billion USD from about 55billion USD the year before. </p>
            <p>The fall of the exchange rate caused the 2019â€“2021 Lebanese protests, which ultimately resulted in 
            the resignation of the prime minister and his cabinet. After the resignation occurred, the COVID-19 
            pandemic forced additional businesses to close their doors and to lay off their employees.</p>
            <p>This liquidity crisis also created a barrier to every single person who had accounts in Lebanese 
            banks; as they are unable to access their deposits. Not only are they unable to access their deposits, 
            but they are unable to withdraw any USD directly. They can withdraw them in the national currency. These 
            depositors needed to preserve the value of their savings, especially following press reports about restructuring 
            of the banking sector. They therefore turned to buying real estate. For example, revenues from land sales of 
            the major real estate developer, Solidere company, soared from nearly $1.3 million to $234.5 million. Also, 
            these depositors turned to buying shares in Solidere company, which lead to a rise of 500% in it between the 
            start of the liquidity crisis and April 2021. </p>
            <p>On 1 June 2021, the World Bank released a report which warned that the economic crisis in Lebanon would 
            risk becoming one of the three most severe since the mid-19th century, if its "bankrupt economic system, 
            which benefited a few for so long" weren't reformed. </p>
